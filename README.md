Civic*Celerator

I've created this project to share some associations I've created for the State of Hawaii Campaign Spending Commission data that was posted on data.hawaii.gov.

There are 85,000+ records on who and how much is being donated to candidates in Hawaii.  The who field, "Name", has not been standardized so there are many variations in spelling for what should be the same person or organization.  I have associated these variations with a standardized name to assist Civic*Celerator teams working with the data.
